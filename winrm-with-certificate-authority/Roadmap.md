# Roadmap

## Prio 1:

1. Refactor the Python code into something one can show to an actual developer without giving him a heart attack.
2. Decide on the final format of Powershell error messages in text mode

## Prio 2:

1. Find a better way to return interleaved stdout/stderr channels than hand-rolled XML

## In no specific order:

- Add an option to serialize Powershell objects to JSON for further processing in KIs (code name "object mode")
- Add documentation on how to use the Windows Active Directory PKI infrastructure instead of OpenSSL
- Investigate PKInit for authentication using AD domain accounts
- Split documentation into separate documents, keeping the Readme short
